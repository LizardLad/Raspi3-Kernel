The only use of OpenGL in this program is to be able to blank the screen really quickly
Things that were created before mmu initialization can be rendered again after the mmu 
has been turned on
This means a black quad will be created that is the size of the screen and that will be
used to blank the screen.
The reason things cannot be created after initialization is because there are cache coherency
issues.
